# 🛠️ Free Time Projects

Welcome to my collection of random coding projects built during my free time!  
This is my personal playground where I experiment, practice, and just have fun with code. 🎉

## 📁 What you'll find here

- Small tools and utilities
- Experiments with different languages (C, Python, etc.)
- Just-for-fun mini projects
- Occasional fails... and lessons learned 😅

## 🚀 Why this repo?

Practice makes perfect!  
This repository helps me learn Git, improve my programming skills, and explore new ideas without pressure.
